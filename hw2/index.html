<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
    While the last assignment showed how you can work with individual triangles, in this assignment, we learned how many triangles can come
    together to build up complex 3D creations from a simple cube to Max Planck. We found it interesting how you can cascade splits and flips across
    an entire mesh to increase its resolution and make it more smooth. In the beginning, we also learned how Bezier curves and surfaces work by manually creating them.
    It was interesting seeing how our implementation of de Casteljau's broke down the segments between points into fewer and fewer segments until it collapsed
    into a singular point, which was on the Bezier curve of the resulting spline. In addition, the algorithm for reducing Bezier surfaces into separate Bezier curves was similar to
    pixel-sampling in the previous assignment, which was interesting to see. All in all, we were able to apply ideas from lecture and turn points into surfaces and 
    surfaces into more complicated yet intricate 3D models.

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p>
    De Casteljau's algorithm takes a set of control points and a interpolation value 0 &gt t &lt 1 in order to generate a point
    on the Bezier curve of the control points. It iteratively takes the n-1 segments between the n points and plots n-1 points that 
    partition each segment by the ratio specified by t. To implement it, we repetitively called a function that took in n points and t,
    and then each iteration outputted n-1 points. We finally returned the only point left.
</p>
<br>


<b>
  Take a look at the provided .bzc files and create your own Bezier curve with 6 control points of your choosing. Use this Bezier curve for your screenshots below.
</b>
<p>
    The 6 points used are as follows: 
    (0.200, 0.350)   (0.100, 0.500)   (0.240, 0.750)  (0.400, 0.800)  (0.600, .500)  (.500, 0.400)

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
    de Casteljau's algorithm can be applied to surfaces by taking a u & v interpolation parameter and 2d points and running
    de Casteljau's on one axis of the points and setting t = u. Then, each curve along the axis is reduced to a point, and you run
    de Casteljau's again on this moving curve, treating it as its own Bezier curve, setting t = v. At the end, you will have reduced 
    the 2D surface into a single point through a 2D de Casteljau's.

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
</b>
<p>
    To implement area-weighted vertex normals, we started with a 3D sum vector = (0,0,0). We iterated around a vertex's halfedges
    to get to each adjacent face/triangle. For each triangle, we used the next() pointer to reach its vetices, saving all three. Then,
    we took the vector form of two of edges by computing v3-v1 and v2-v1. We took the cross-product of these two edges, which gave us 
    the normal vector for that surface with a magnitude indicating twice its area. Then, we added each cross product 
    to the sum vector and normalized.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    The edge flipping operation was done through a series of pointer reassignments. Using the passed in edge,
    we created an initial mapping of edges, vertices, faces, and halfedges for the initial layout of the two triangles.
    After updating each of the vertices, edges, and faces to the corresponding halfedges and setting the new neighbors
    of each of the halfedges, we were able to adjust the triangles so they were flipped.

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    Similar to Part 4, the edge splitting operation was done through a series of pointer reassignments. Using the
    passed in edge, we created an initial mapping of edges, vertices, faces, and halfedges for the initial layout of
    the two triangles. For splitting specifically, we had to add new faces, edges, and halfedges with the addition of
    a new vertex in the middle. After adjusting the existing triangle properties so that they would map to the new
    properties correctly, we set the position for the new vertex to the midpoint of two of the opposite vertices. This
    allowed us to split the two triangles effectively with one new vertex in the middle.

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    To do loop subdivision, instead of splitting & flipping first, we first calculated what the new position would be for all of the old vertices and unmarked the "new" value 
    on all of these vertices. Then, we iterated through all of the edges, since the new vertices would be on the midpoint of these old edges.
    Then, we calculated what the new position of these vertices would be by calculating the weighted average of its neighbors, with a higher weight for the vertices
    on the ends of the edge. Then, we iterated through all of the edges, splitting them and implicitly marking them as new, and checking for this flag 
    before splitting the rest of the edges. Then, after all the edges are split, we flip the new edges that connect new and old vertices.
    At the end, we want to make sure our the vertices in our next level of upsampling are in the right position, so we update their positions to the positions 
    calculated in the beginning.
</p>
<br>


<b>
  Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?
</b>
<p>
    After loop subdivision, each of the shapes become much smoother. Sharp corners and edges round and smooth out, making a
    much more curvy surface. Although the mesh becomes a higher resolution, these sharp features become less distinct and more blurred into its surroundings 
    due to the averaging of neighboring vertices. To preserve this detail, you can make more splits over these sharp features, increasing
    the number of vertices representing it, thus preserving it across multiple loop subdivisions.

<b>
  Load dae/cube.dae. Perform several iterations of loop subdivision on the cube. Notice that the cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions. Can you pre-process the cube with edge flips and splits so that the cube subdivides symmetrically? Document these effects and explain why they occur. Also explain how your pre-processing helps alleviate the effects.
</b>

<p>
  The original meshes were only on the edges of the cube and from corner to corner on each face. The lack of symmetry on each face 
  can lead to a lack of symmetry when subdividing the mesh. When we do our flip after splitting the diagonal mesh, the flip makes
  all of the meshes face the same direction as the initial diagonal mesh. As a result, we decided to make our original meshes symmetric
  across each face by splitting all the diagonals first and then the edges of the cube. This created an asterisk-like mesh on each mesh.
  Then, flipping each diagonal edge from the center of the face to the corner created a diamond shape that maintained symmetry upon 
  loop subdivision.
